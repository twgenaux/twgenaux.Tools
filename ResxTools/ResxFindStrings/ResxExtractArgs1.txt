# Argslist.txt - Program Args file is a list of one or more args listed below.
#                 Can be any name so long as it does now have a resx file extesion.
# 
# /allfiles:patern - File pattern  for all Resx files (*.resx)
# 
# /trans:patern - File pattern for all translated Resx files (*.??*.resx)
# 
# /lang:patern - A file pattern with the language code to search for strings 
# 
# /src:folder - Root folder with all Resx files live
# 
# /out:pathname - Output path for the T0-Be-Translated XML file
# 
# ID - One or more unique Resx string ID (name)
# 
# Examples:
# 
# *.resx : Matches all files with a .resx extension.
# 
# *.??*.resx : Matches all files with language codes of two characters or more.
# 
# *.fr.resx :  Matches files with the French language code.
# 
# File Patterns
# 1. To find strings in source (untranslated) Resx files:
#     - Include /lang:*.en.resx with the file pattern with a source language code.
#     If no language code is included in the source Resx filename, then:
#     - Include /allfiles:*.resx with the file pattern of all Resx files.
#     - Include /trans:*.??*.resx with the file pattern of all translated Resx files.
#     The tool will create a list of All-Files and Translated-Files. It will then
#     remove the translated files from the list of All-Files, leaving only the source files.
# 2. To search individual language Resx files. Include a file pattern for each language:
#    /lang:*.fr.resx
#    /lang:*.ja.resx
#    /lang:*.zh-CN.resx
# 3. To find strings in only one source Resx file:
#    /lang:C:\ResxFiles\Customer.fr.resx
# 
#    Resx string IDs (name), provide a list of the IDs:
#    /lang:*.fr.resx
#    /lang:*.ja.resx
#    /lang:*.zh-CN.resx

# Example - no language code is included in source filenames
/allfiles:*.resx
/trans:*.??*.resx
/src:D:\ResxTools\Translations # Source folder

/out:/out:D:\ResxTools\ResxExtractArgs2.txt.xml # XML To-Be-Translated Report

# List of the Resx identifiers to be translated
