# File Patterns
# 1. To search for the source (untranslated) Resx files:
#     - Include /lang:*.en.resx with the file patten with the source language code.
#
#     If no language code is included in the source Resx filename, then:
#     - Include /allfiles:*.resx with the file patten all Resx files
#     - Include /trans:*.??*.resx with the file patten all translated Resx files
#     The tool will create a list of All-Files and Translated-Files. It will then
#     remove the translated files from the list of All-Files, leaving only the source files.
#
# 2. To search individule language Resx files. Include a file pattern for each language:
#    /lang:*.fr.resx # File pattern for a specific language
#    /lang:*.ja.resx # File pattern for a specific language
#    /lang:*.zh-CN.resx # File pattern for a specific languag

# Resx string IDs (name), just provide a list of the IDs:
#    /lang:*.fr.resx
#    /lang:*.ja.resx
#    /lang:*.zh-CN.resx

### Example - no language code is included in source filenames
/allfiles:*.resx
/trans:*.??*.resx
/src:E:\APSW_5.16.0.47707.ResX # Source folder

/out:Example_Resx_Strings_To-Be-Translated.xml # XML To-Be-Translated list

# List of the Resx identifieers to be translated
