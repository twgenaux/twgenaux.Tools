# Windows Wildcard File Search
# 
# - Asterisk (`*`)**: Matches any number of characters, including zero.
# - Question mark (`?`)**: Matches a single character.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# - *.resx : Matches all files with a `.resx` extension.
# - *.??*.resx : Matches all files with language codes two of characters or more.
# - *.fr.resx : Matches files  with the French language code.
# 
# File Patterns
# 1. To find strings in source (untranslated) Resx files:
#     - Include /lang:*.en.resx with the file patten with the source language code.
#
#     If no language code is included in the source Resx filename, then:
#     - Include /allfiles:*.resx with the file patten all Resx files
#     - Include /trans:*.??*.resx with the file patten all translated Resx files
#     The tool will create a list of All-Files and Translated-Files. It will then
#     remove the translated files from the list of All-Files, leaving only the source files.
#
# 2. To search individule language Resx files. Include a file pattern for each language:
#    /lang:*.fr.resx
#    /lang:*.ja.resx
#    /lang:*.zh-CN.resx
#
# 3. To find strings in only one source Resx file:
#    /lang:C:\ResxFiles\Customer.fr.resx
#
# Resx string IDs (name), just provide a list of the IDs:
#    /lang:*.fr.resx
#    /lang:*.ja.resx
#    /lang:*.zh-CN.resx

### Example - no language code is included in source filenames
/allfiles:*.resx
/trans:*.??*.resx
/src:"E:\APSW_5.16.0.47707.ResX"" # Source folder

/out:Example_Resx_Strings_To-Be-Translated.xml # XML To-Be-Translated list

# List of the Resx identifieers to be translated
